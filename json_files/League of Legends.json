 		"text": "It is modeled after the Warcraft III map, Defense of the Ancients. It shows many similarities. This map is the main map where the League of Legends game is played the most and where tournaments are held. You can also add AI champions to teams or play against AI on this map.It is the map where the blue team and the red team, which have an equal number of players, with a maximum of 5 players in each team, fight. There is a blue team in the lower left corner of the map and a red team in the upper right corner. There are a total of 3 lanes connecting the home bases of the two teams (top laner, mid lane and bottom lane). Both teams have three towers and inhibitors on each lane. Towers provide a great advantage for opposing team players to defend themselves. Destroying inhibitors increases the power of the minions of the destroying side."
