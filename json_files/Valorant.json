		"text": "Straight from the files of Brimstone, this is the VALORANT Beginner’s Guide. Whether this is your first rotation or you're needing a refresher, we figure it’s best you take it from the Agent who’s seen it all before.Before you enter your first round, you get to pick from a group of Agents, each with their own role and special skills designed to work alongside each other toward a win. You can dig into the specifics of each Agent on our Agents page.After everyone selects their Agent (oh, you picked that one), you’ll jump into a random map and formally enter the first round."
